## Logging

### Fluentd

We're using [fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/) to aggregate the logs and send them to both an [ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack) and S3 bucket for long term storage.

#### Deployment

Create or target a common space using `cf create-space common` or `cf target -o beis-mspsds -s common`.

Deploy the fluentd app by running `cf push --no-start --hostname <fluentd hostname>` from the `fluentd` folder.

Once the app has been created, add the following environment variables for the Logit and S3 credentials.
The values can be found on the respective websites.
    cf set-env fluentd AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID XXX
    cf set-env fluentd AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY XXX
    cf set-env fluentd AWS_REGION XXX
    cf set-env fluentd AWS_S3_BUCKET XXX
    cf set-env fluentd LOGIT_STACK_ID XXX
    cf set-env fluentd LOGIT_PORT XXX

Once the environment variables are set, start the app using `cf start fluentd`.

To start sending logs from an application, create a log drain on the specific space using `cf cups opss-log-drain -l https://<fluentd domain>`
Then bind the service to each application using e.g. `cf bind-service mspsds-web opss-log-drain`.


### Logit

We're using [Logit](https://logit.io) as a hosted ELK stack.
If you want to view the logs, you'll need an account - ask someone on the team to invite you.
You should sign up using GitHub OAuth to ensure MFA.

[logstash-filters.conf](./logstash-filters.conf) provides a set of rules which logstash can use to parse Cloud Foundry logs.


### S3

We're using AWS S3 as a long term storage for logs.
See [the root README](../README.md#amazon-web-services) for more details about setting up an account.


## Monitoring

### Metrics

TODO MSPSDS-786: Probably using https://github.com/alphagov/paas-metric-exporter as a base


### Uptime check

We're using [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com) to perform a regular uptime check on our website.
If you want to receive emails, ask someone on the team to add you to the list of "Alert Contacts".


### Sentry

We're using [Sentry](https://sentry.io) to monitor exceptions.
If you want to view the exceptions, you'll need an account - ask someone on the team to invite you.
You should sign up using GitHub OAuth to ensure MFA.
