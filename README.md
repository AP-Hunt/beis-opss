# BEIS - Market Surveillance & Product Safety Digital Service

## Getting Setup
Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/install/

Install docker-compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
Then in a different terminal initialise the DB
```
docker-compose run web rake db:create
```
Visit the site on localhost:3000

### Windows Subsystem for Linux
You will have to install the docker server on Windows, and the docker client on WSL

To make this work, make the current path look like a windows path to appease Windows Docker
```
sudo ln -s /mnt/c /c
cd /c/path/to/project
```

## Tests
You can run the tests with the following command:
```
docker-compose run web rails test
```

You can run the linting with:
```
docker-compose run web rubocop
```

Running this with the --auto-correct flag set will cause rubocop to attempt to fix as many of the issues as it can.
